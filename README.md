<h1>
  MAX FLOW COMPARISON  
</h1>

In this repository you can find a comparison between FIFO preflow push algorithm and Shortest Augmenting Path algorithm to compute max flow. <br>

In particular: <br>
-FIFO_improved: implementation of the FIFO preflow push algorithm.<br>
-SAPA: implementation of the Shortest Augmenting Path algorithm.<br>
-problem_generator_improved: implementation of a problem generator, given number of nodes, edges and max capacities generate a digraph with those characteristics.<br>
-main_improved: implementation of a main where several experiments can be run sequentially and the results saved in a csv file.<br>
-main: implementation of a main where the user can choose the parameters of the graph creation and can run several experiments.<br>
