<h1>
  MAX FLOW COMPARISON  
</h1>

In this repository yoou can find a comparison between FIFO preflow push algorithm and Shortest Augmenting Path algorithm to compute max flow. There is also a problem generator that given the number of nodes, number of edges and maximum capacity create a directed graph with with those characteristics.
